# CoCo-Demo
This repository contains the `.yaml` source files to set up Confidential Containers without confidential hardware, according to this blog post: [https://confidentialcontainers.org/blog/2024/12/03/confidential-containers-without-confidential-hardware/](https://confidentialcontainers.org/blog/2024/12/03/confidential-containers-without-confidential-hardware/). The `src` directory contains the `.yaml` files when implemented using Kind, and the `trustee` directory contains the operator which manages the lifecycle of the trustee (which are the services used to perform attestation) when deployed in the Kubernetes cluster. In particular, `coco-demo-01.yaml`contains a regular busybox image, and `coco-demo-02.yaml` builds on top of `coco-demo-01.yaml` by setting a policy for the kata-agent to ensure the host is not executing the container (as the host is not trusted).
